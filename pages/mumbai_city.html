      <u><h3>About:</h3></u><p>The <b>Gateway of India</b> is one of Mumbai’s most famous landmarks.
It was built in <b>1924</b> to commemorate the visit of <b>King George V and Queen Mary</b> to India in 1911.
Located at <b>Apollo Bunder,</b> near the <b>Taj Mahal Palace Hotel,</b> it overlooks the <b>Arabian Sea.</b>
<br>The structure is designed in Indo-Saracenic architecture, made of yellow basalt and reinforced concrete.
It is about 26 meters (85 feet) high.
After India gained independence in 1947, the last British troops left India through this gateway, making it a symbol of both colonial legacy and freedom.
Today, it is a popular tourist attraction and starting point for ferry rides to Elephanta Caves and other nearby islands.
The area around the Gateway is always lively with street vendors, photographers, and sea views.</p>
